    <br><br>
    <h4>Working: Click on "Go to GCKey" button. If credentials are set, it will log you in to GCKey. If credentials are not set, you will be redirected to 'options' page to set credentials first.</h4>
    <h4>Change your login credentials by going to the 'options' page.</h4>
    <p>
        <b>Pro-Tip: </b>GCKey website often has issues while logging-in. You can often be redirected to "https://www.cic.gc.ca/". Simple solution is to click on extension button and click on the "Go to GCKey" button which will re-attempt the login. If the issue persists, repeat! Generally you should be able to login by 5th-6th try. If not, then there is some major issue with the GCKey website and you should wait for sometime and then try again.

        and saved. <br>
        The extension will not be maintained. Therefore, it is possible that it stops working if IRCC changes the GCKey
        login pages/process.</p>
