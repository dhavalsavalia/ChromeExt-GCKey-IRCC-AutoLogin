# Chrome Extension for Automated Login to GCKey IRCC Account

## Tips & Tricks
If you are getting problems with logging in (i.e. GCKey is giving some errors like taking you to the homepage) you do NOT need to clear cache or cookies or open incognito. Just go to https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/account.html again and let the chrome extension do its magic. If it again fails, repeat the process 5-6 times, it should work. If it still fails, there is some problem with GCKey so try again after some time.
